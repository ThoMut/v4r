* Merge branch 'master' into dynamic_object_learning
* removed aitor from maintainer list
* Merge remote-tracking branch 'strands/package_xml'
* Merge branch 'master' into dynamic_object_learning
* added parameter class for noise model based integration
  changed Eigen::Vector4f vector for correct allocation
* indices are now stored in a more generic way
  visualization now also includes noise model
  added Statistical Outlier Removal for initial indices
  added logical operator for binary masks
  TODO: visualization does only work for first service call
* added opencv dependency
* fixed dependencies to the correct rosdep keys
* added a first package.xml
* MST is now a parameter
  plane indices are stored as a vector of a vector now - (otherwise high cost occured in callgrind profiler)
  updated clear function
* Merge branch 'master' into dynamic_object_learning
* createDirIfNotExist function is now in common
* fixed problem with nan values (recursive absolute pose computation based on spanning tree implementation was not correct)
* minimum spanning tree is working now... there are nan values transferred to nearest neighbor search -> still needs to be fixed!
* bug fix - should be back to STRANDS review demo state
